**Play Music Project** wants to enable all comers to make, compose and improvise music in a collaborative, experimental and supportive environment - just for fun!

We are running a pilot in the next three weeks at FUSE Art Space in Rawson Place, Bradford, BD13QQ.

These workshops are entirely free and we welcome your participation and collaboration in whatever way you choose. You can bring instruments or just yourselves. The participants will mould the shape of the music and the way the workshops develop.

After Christmas we will review the pilot and take the next steps which include plans to initiate the workshops across the district with different leaders.

_Please be in touch to let us know if you are coming and if you have any questions._
